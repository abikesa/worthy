    "\n",
    "The `$(eval ...)` construct in a shell script is used to evaluate a command and then execute it. Here’s a breakdown of what each component does:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`$( ... )`**: This is command substitution. It executes the command inside the parentheses and replaces it with the output of the command. For example, `$(echo \"Hello\")` will be replaced by `Hello`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`eval ...`**: The `eval` command takes a string as an argument and executes it as if it were a command. For example, `eval echo \"Hello\"` will execute `echo \"Hello\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When combined as `$(eval ...)`, it first evaluates the inner command and then executes the resulting string as a command. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "SSH_KEY_PATH=\"~/.ssh/id_rsa\"\n",
    "echo $(eval echo $SSH_KEY_PATH)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what happens step-by-step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `eval echo $SSH_KEY_PATH` is evaluated. Since `SSH_KEY_PATH` is set to `~/.ssh/id_rsa`, it becomes `eval echo ~/.ssh/id_rsa`.\n",
    "2. `eval echo ~/.ssh/id_rsa` is executed, which outputs `/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa` (assuming `~` expands to `/home/username`).\n",
    "\n",
    "This effectively resolves and expands any variables or tilde (`~`) notation in the path, ensuring that the command receives the correct, fully expanded file path.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of your script, `$(eval echo $SSH_KEY_PATH)` ensures that the path provided by `SSH_KEY_PATH` is fully expanded before it's used in commands like `chmod` or `ssh-add`.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Check Your GitHub Credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Re-authenticate with GitHub**:\n",
    "   - Ensure you're logged in with the correct GitHub account.\n",
    "   - Open the terminal and run:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",

    "\n",
    "### SSL/TLS Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Check SSL/TLS Configuration**:\n",
    "   - Modify the Git SSL verification settings. Sometimes, the SSL certificate verification might cause issues. Temporarily disable SSL verification to test:\n",

    "     git config --global http.sslVerify true\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Network Configuration\n",

    "   - Check your network connection. A weak or unstable connection might cause this error. Try pushing your changes from a different network.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Large File Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Reduce Push Size** (`skipped this`): \n",
    "   - If your push contains large files, consider reducing the size of the push by using Git LFS (Large File Storage):\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Clear Git Credentials from Credential Manager**:\n",
    "   - On **Windows**:\n",
    "     - Open the Credential Manager (Control Panel > User Accounts > Credential Manager).\n",
